##How To Contribute
The ability to contribute and collaborate are what make **git** so great. This bot is still very young.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working and the bot more useful.

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.


##Getting Started - How Can I Contribute
**Quick Overview**

* Make Sure you have a Github Account :)
* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
	* This is usually the master branch.
	* Only target other branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch
* Make commits of logical units

##Style Guides

Adopted from [Howdyai/botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

###General Code
* End files with a newline.
* Place requires in the following order:
  * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
  * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Avoid platform-dependent code:
  * Use `path.join()` to concatenate filenames.
* Using a plain `return` when returning explicitly at the end of a function.
  * Not `return null`, `return undefined`, `null`, or `undefined`


### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Make commits of logical units  		
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
